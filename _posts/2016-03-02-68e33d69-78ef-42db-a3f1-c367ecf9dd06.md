Ignore anything you have been told. Nightlord will not be playing a secret show at the Hobgoblin tonight at 8pm as a warm-up to SEPULTURA + NIGHTLORD + REVOKER, Sepuku will not be opening at 7pm, and there will be no fun, frivolity and good music afterwards with Nocturnal Lust till 2am and anything you have heard to the contrary must clearly be the product of a deranged imagination ;-p
